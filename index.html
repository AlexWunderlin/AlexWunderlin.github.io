                        Hi, I'm Alex Wunderlin, Software Engineer and Game Developer. Creativity and problem-solving
                        are my specialty. Since I first started programming at the age of ten, I've gained 10+ years of
                        valuable experience developing video games and programming personal projects.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Software Engineering as a Junior at MSOE. At MSOE I work on
                        numerous programming projects each week, only furthering my existing experience. Through my
                        education I have become skilled in topics such as AI, algorithms, databases, operating systems,
                        computer networking, cybersecurity, web design, software design patterns, software tools such as
                        GIT, and practices such as AGILE software development.

                        With each new project came new goals, new challenges, and new programming languages. Listed below
                        are some of the languages I have significant experience with. (Something about learning new languages)

                    <p class="text">
                        As an Automation Engineer Apprentice at KI, I was responsible for helping maintain, implement
                        and improve manufacturing equipment. Responding to calls when equipment encountered issues was
                        one of my main duties, and being able to diagnose and fix issues quickly was a skill that I
                        exercised on a daily basis to ensure operations remained productive. At the core of most systems
                        I worked with was a programmable logic controller; consistently working with these systems taught
                        me a lot of skills for bridging the gap between computers and the physical world. Many of the challenges
                        I faced were unlike anything I had encountered before, being able to adapt and learn new skills
                        on the fly was essential to my success at KI.

                        As a parks employee, I was responsible for maintaining park landscaping and facilities.
                        Coordinating with my team and working together to ensure we stayed on top of our large list of
                        responsibilities was of high importance. Every day came with new tasks, one of which I was able
                        to take advantage of my automation skills. When the release button for the firewood vending
                        machine broke I stepped up to fix it. Originally I was supposed to replace the broken button, but
                        it was poorly located and difficult to access. So I took the initiative to instead order a key
                        switch which I installed on the face of the box, restoring functionality and making the switch
                        easier to access.

                        During the spring semester of my sophmore year, I chose to study abroad in New Zealand at
