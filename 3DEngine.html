                    <p class="text">
                        My 3D engine is a simple program on scratch that renders a list of 3D coordinates.
                        The user controls the camera which they can move throughout environment and rotate to face
                        different directions.

                        Making a 3D game was something I had always wanted to do since I first started making video
                        games. To make a 3D game, I first needed to learn how to display things in 3D, so I began
                        development on a simple 3D program. It didn't need to be anything fancy, just a starting point I
                        could later improve upon. It was important that the program I made was something I could
                        call my own, hence I avoided tutorials and other resources.

                    <h1 class="title">How it Works</h1>
                    <p class="text">
                        The basic idea comes down to how 3D points are converted to 2D points that can be displayed on a
                        screen. Imagine two points, one to represent the camera and one to represent a point to be displayed.
                        Now imagine a plane in front of the camera, perpendicular to the ray representing the direction
                        the camera is facing. On that plane lies a coordinate grid with the origin being where it is
                        intersected by the ray. By connecting the camera and the other point with a line, you can find
                        the point's 2D location on the screen using the 2D coordinate of where that line intersects the
                        plane. Note that in this example (0, 0) is located in the center of the screen. Obviously anything
                        with a 2D coordinate outside the bounds of the screen would not be displayed. The distance of
                        the plane from the camera and the scale of the coordinate grid can vary and affects the field of
                        view and zoom.
