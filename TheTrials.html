                    <p class="text">
                        The Trials is a puzzle platformer programmed entirely in Java. Like many platformers, the player
                        controls a character with the goal of reaching the end of the level. To make the game
                        interesting, each level is filled with numerous obstacles. Some of these obstacles can be
                        overcome with timing and dexterity, while others require the player to navigate a maze of logic
                        and use creative thinking to overcome them.

                    <p class="text">
                        This project was inspired by the original version of the game, initially created by me on
                        Scratch. The goal was to recreate the game as a standalone piece of software. Throughout its
                        redevelopment I took a lot of opportunities to improve many of the original features and
                        implement new ones as they came to mind.

                    <h1 class="title">How it Works</h1>
                    <p class="text">
                        The engine roughly follows the MVC design pattern. A majority of the work is done in the
                        controller which is represented by a main driver assisted by a class to manage the menu and
                        another to run the engine. The model consists of objects representing various game features such
                        as the ground, lasers, and the player. The view is handled in a separate thread which
                        continuously rerenders the game based off the latest contents of the model. The model is updated
                        in a similar loop within the controller, each cycle updates the model based on user input and
                        the model itself.

                    <h3 class="header">Detecting Player Collisions</h3>
                    <p class="text">
                        Each time the player moves, a method is called to check for collisions. If the player is
                        colliding with the ground, the player's position is reverted to its previous state. If the player
                        is colliding with a hazard, a method is called to resolve the player's death. The method for
                        determining whether the player is colliding differs based on the objects type being checked. For
                        the ground, spikes, and acid which all share the same polygon structure, checking if any of the
                        player's corners are within that polygon suffices assuming nothing is more narrow than the
                        player.

                        Lasers are a bit different as they are defined by a line, I found that checking to see if they
                        intersect with the player to be the best way to check for collisions. To determine if
                        the laser intersects with the player, I chose to use two lines that form an x across the player's
                        hitbox. Any laser intersecting the player would have to intersect one of those lines. Note that
                        this only accounts for lasers that fully intersect the player and was chosen because it's fail
                        cases are outside the scope of the game and is more efficient than checking for intersects with all
                        four of the player's edges.
